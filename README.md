statslab
========

This is the repository for my PythonStatsLab project

PythonStatsLab is a collection of Python modules to be used as learning aids for introductory and intermediate-level probability and statistics courses. They can be used to calculate probabilities, z-alpha values, calculate confidence intervals, etc.

These functions would come in handy to anyone taking courses in probability, statistics or data analysis, and they're a good way to learn how common statistical packages compute their solutions. For example, there are several numerical integration techniques (Riemann sum, Simpson's method, Taylor expansion, etc.) that can be used to integrate the Bell Curve, some of which are covered in my program.

Current Features
----------------
* Integration of a standard normal distribution
* Integration of any normal distribution (given the values of μ and σ)
* Display a graph of the integration
* Calculate Zα for a given value of α
* Calculate confidence intervals for a standard normal random variable (SNRV)
* Perform hypothesis testing for an SNRV


Possible Future Additions
-------------------------
* Implement all features above for the Student's t distribution
* Hart's algorithm to compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which is used by some statistical software
* Probabilities involving 2 random variables
* Stochastic integration
